# Visa Requirements for Off-Plan Property Investors (UAE)

### Can I get a visa from an off-plan property?
No. You cannot obtain a property-based residence visa from an off-plan property until it is completed.

This is because UAE law requires:
- Property must be fully constructed
- Property must be habitable
- A title deed must be issued

### Why does off-plan not qualify for residency?
The law requires:
- A completed property
- Official ownership certificate
- Proof the property is livable

Off-plan properties do not meet these conditions.

### What visa options do I have during construction?
You must rely on another visa type, such as:
- Employment visa
- Tourist visa
- Other residency pathways

### What are the requirements for a property owner visa?
Once completed, you may qualify if:
- You fully own the property
- The property is habitable
- You earn ≥ AED 10,000/month or prove financial solvency

### What is the Golden Visa requirement for property investors?
- Minimum property value: AED 2 million
- Can include multiple properties
- Must be in your name
- Mortgages allowed (with bank NOC)

### Can I get a Golden Visa with a mortgage?
Yes, if:
- You meet the AED 2M threshold
- You provide a bank no-objection letter

### Do visa rules differ across emirates?
- Federal law applies across UAE
- Dubai provides the clearest implementation
- Other emirates may vary but are less clearly documented

### Key takeaway for off-plan investors
Buying off-plan does NOT give residency until:
- Construction is complete
- Title deed is issued
