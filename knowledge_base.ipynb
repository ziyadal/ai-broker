       "'To get a UAE **Golden Visa via real estate**, the main route is owning UAE property with a qualifying value.\\n\\n### Eligibility (property investor)\\n- **Minimum property value:** **AED 2,000,000**\\n- **Can be one or multiple properties** (combined value can count)\\n- **Property must be in your name**\\n- **Mortgages are allowed** in many cases — typically you’ll need a **bank NOC (No Objection Certificate)** confirming the mortgage/paid amount as required\\n\\n(Source: Dubai Land Department “Request for Golden Visa Investor” e-service)\\n\\n### Typical process (high level)\\n1. **Own qualifying property** (ready or off-plan, as long as it meets the requirements and is in your name)\\n2. Apply through the relevant government channel (in Dubai, commonly via **Dubai Land Department** service)\\n3. After initial approval, you complete the **residency issuance steps** (medical, Emirates ID, etc.). You’re generally allowed to stay **up to 60 days from entry** while completing issuance procedures.\\n\\n### What I need from you to guide you accurately\\n1) Which emirate are you buying in (Dubai / Abu Dhabi / etc.)?  \\n2) Is the property **ready** or **off-plan**?  \\n3) Is it **cash** or **mortgaged** and what’s the approx value?\\n\\nReply with those 3 and I’ll outline the exact practical steps and the usual documents for your case.'"
